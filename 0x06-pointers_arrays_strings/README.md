1-strncat.c
Write a function that concatenates two strings. The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.

2-strncpy.c
Write a function that copies a string.

3-strcmp.c
Write a function that compares two strings.

4-rev_array.c

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1

100-rot13.c
Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.

101-print_number.c

Created a header file "main.h" that I used for my _putchar prototype.
Created a main.c file to call out to the main function as a starting point for my code.

The 0-putchar.c writes a program that prints to the standard output- _putchar.

The 1-alphabet.c program prints the alphabet, in lowercase followed by a new line.

The 2-print_alphabet_x10.c program prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times followed by a new line.

The 3-islower.c program checks for lowercase character.

The 4-isalpha.c program checks for alphabetic character.

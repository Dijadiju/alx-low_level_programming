Created a header file "main.h" that I used for my _putchar prototype.
Created a main.c file to call out to the main function as a starting point for my code.

The 0-putchar.c writes a program that prints to the standard output- _putchar.

The 1-alphabet.c program prints the alphabet, in lowercase followed by a new line.

The 2-print_alphabet_x10.c program prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times followed by a new line.

The 3-islower.c program checks for lowercase character.

The 4-isalpha.c program checks for alphabetic character.

The 5-sign.c program prints the sign of a number.

The 6-abs.c program computes the absolute value of an integer.

The 8-24_hours.c program prints  minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

The 9-times_table.c program  prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

The 10-add.c program adds two integers and returns the result.

The 11-print_to_98.c program  prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

The 100-times_table.c program prints the n times table, starting with 0.
